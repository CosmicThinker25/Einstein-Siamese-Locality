**Geometric resolution of Bell's theorem restoring Einstein locality via CPT-Siamese dual universes.**

This repository hosts the theoretical framework and observational analysis proposing that entangled particles are single, continuous objects connecting two time-reversed universes via a global phase coordinate ($\Delta\phi$). We demonstrate that the nonlocality observed in standard Bell experiments is a projection of strictly local dynamics in this higher-dimensional manifold.

## 📂 Repository Structure

To compile the manuscript correctly, maintain the following directory structure:

```text
.
├── EinsteinLocality_CPT_SiameseUniverses_v1.tex  (Main LaTeX source file)
├── EinsteinLocality_CPT_SiameseUniverses_v1.pdf  (Compiled paper)
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
└── figs/                                         (Folder containing all figures)
    ├── 1.png
    ├── 2.png
    ├── 3.png

How to Compile

The LaTeX source code is located in the root directory.

    Ensure you have a standard LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX).

    Make sure the figs folder contains the images named 1.png through 6.png.

    Open EinsteinLocality_CPT_SiameseUniverses_v1.tex in your editor.

    Run your compiler (pdflatex, XeLaTeX, etc.).

        Note: The code uses the float package to ensure strict image placement.
